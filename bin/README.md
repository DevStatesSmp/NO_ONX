# BEFORE DO ANYTHING
# WARNING: This directory is intended to store compiled .exe files generated from C++ sources.
#
# IMPORTANT EXECUTABLES (DO NOT DELETE):
# - detective.exe           (used by the watcher module)
# - process_anomaly_detective.exe   (used for process anomaly detection)
# REASON:
# These executables must remain intact because:
# 1. You may not have a C++ compiler installed on your system.
# 2. If you delete these files, the command will attempt to recompile them.
# 3. Without a proper C++ compiler, recompilation will fail, causing errors.
#
# Please avoid deleting these executables to ensure stable operation.
